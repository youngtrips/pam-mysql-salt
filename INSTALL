Typical:

1. Run "configure" script. The following parameters are accepted.

    --with-pam=[PAM_INSTALLATION_PREFIX]

        Specifies where the PAM headers required to build
        the package are installed. This may help when you are
        building a system in a different root. This can be
        omitted to turn on auto-detection.

    --with-pam-mods-dir=[MODULE_DIRECTORY]

        Specifies where to install the product
        (pam_mysql.so). This can be omitted also.

    --with-mysql=[MYSQL_INSTALLATION_PREFIX]

        Specifies where the required MySQL headers and
        libraries are installed. If not given, configure search
        to find them amongst the hard-coded prefixes in the
        following order:

        . /usr
        . /usr/local
        . /usr/mysql
        . /opt/mysql

    --with-openssl=[OPENSSL_INSTALLATION_PREFIX]

        Specifies where the OpenSSL headers and libraries are
        installed. If the option is supplied but no prefix is
        explicitly given, configure tries to search them amongst
        the hard-coded prefixes in the following order:

        . /usr
        . /usr/local
        . /opt/openssl
        . /usr/ssl
        . /usr/local/ssl

    --with-cyrus-sasl=[CYRUS_SASL_INSTALLATION_PREFIX]
    --with-cyrus-sasl2=[CYRUS_SASL2_INSTALLATION_PREFIX]

        Specifies where the Cyrus SASL headers and libraries, which
        will be used for MD5 calculation facility, are installed.
        If the option is supplied but no prefix is explicitly given,
        configure tries to search them amongst the hard-coded prefixes
        in the following order:

        . /usr
        . /usr/local
        . /opt/cyrus-sasl

        Note that these two options cannot be specified together, and
        it is discouraged to use this feature in order to avoid cross
        dependency and symbol conflict as PAM may be called from within
        a SASL client library.

2. make install

3. Make proper changes to an intended configuration file in /etc/pam.d/
   or /etc/pam.conf.

Via RPM commands:

1. Copy the source archive (.tar.gz / .tar.bz2) to the "SOURCES" directory
   within the system dependent RPM build directory.
   That is typically /usr/src/redhat in Red Hat / Fedora Core distros.

2. Copy the spec file (pam_mysql.spec), that has been generated during
   configuration to the "SPECS" directory, that is also found in the same
   RPM build directory as explained in the previous step.

3. Chdir to the SPECS directory

4. Run rpmbuild.

   $ rpmbuild -ba pam_mysql.spec

5. Install the binary-rpm that was produced in the "RPMS" directory, ditto.

  (via ordinary make install)

6. Make proper changes to an intended configuration file in /etc/pam.d/
   or /etc/pam.conf.
